# RSA-Algorithm-x86-ASM

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of RSA(public key encryption technology) in Assembly Language(x86)
### Prerequisites and Requirements/Configurations for Source Code 
Before you can run the program , you need to : 

    1.Install an IDE and install relevant extensions for x86 MASM.
  
In this case , I have used Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
 
You can easily download  IDE from :
 
*Visual Studio 2019 : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
 
    

#### Program Execution 
  1.Choose an Option whether to encrypt(1) the testcases file or decrypt(2)
  
  2.If Option 1 is selected , you will be provided with a public key(d) and value of mod (n)
  
  3.You must remember the keys in order to decrypt the files back to plain text.
  
  4.If option 2 is selected, program will ask you to input the public key and the value of mod for plain text conversion.
